# compiler-design
A simple compiler designed for C language

* Lexical analyzer is written using `lex`, and the parser using `yacc`
* Some semantic analysis is performed along with syntax analysis for type checking, etc. for which symbol table is utilized
* Intermediate code is generated for assignment expressions

## Look inside the `lexical_analyzer` folder for some other approaches (naive and finite-automaton) used for lexical analysis
